##### Solution Walkthrough


### Supervised Learning
- Trained using **Labeled Examples** such as an input where the desired output is known
- Segment of text could have a label : Spam vs. Legit for an email
- Positive vs. Negative for a review
- Neural network receives a set of input data and what output it should produce. 
- Supervised learning is used to predict likely future events. 

#### Steps
- Data Acquisition - Get your data
- Data Cleaning - clean and format so your neural net can process it
- Split data between test and training, use the training set to fit the model to the data, and then test it against test data. 
- Test the model and adjust the model parameters
- Deploy the model

### Data Sets
- Training data used to train the model params
- Validation Data used to determine what mdoel hyperparameters to adjust
- Test data used for final performance metrics.
