### Two methods of Plot Building
- Functional Method (used in dset), call plot on a set of vars
- Object Oriented method, generate a blank figure object then populate

- With object oriented your steps include creating a blank figure object, add axes, generate plots, specify plot parameters
- Subplots = plotting figure that contains more than one plot


- Matplotlib has a ton of colors, line styles, symbols, etc. check documentation for references.

### Labeling Plot features

- Additionally has a functional and OOP method
- Useful for explaining data

- Annotating is done with the following
.annotate(xy,xytext,arrowprop)
 xy = the location being annotated
 xytext = the location of the text

 ### Time Series Plots
 - Measure of unit change over time for any variable under observation
 - Built in python datetime module suplies classes for manipulating date/time in simple and complex ways


 ### Statistical Plots
 - Identify Outliers
 - Visualize Distributions
 - Deduce Variable types
 - Discover relationships and core relations between variables in a dataset
