## Neural Networks with a perceptron
- Perceptron = neural network with just one layer, linear classifier that outputs a binary response variable
- Data is said to have 'linear separability' if it can be cleanly classified into one of two classes
- Data must be linearly separable in order for a perceptron to operate properly

#### Elements of Perceptron
- Input layer, weights and bias, activation function, ouput
- Activation function = mathematical function deployed on each unit in a neural network, all units in a shared layer deploy the same activation function, purpose is to enable neural networks to model complex nonlinear phenoms
- Linear, logistic sigmoid, threshold, etc


## K-nearest Neighbor Classification
- Memorize observations within a test set to predict classification labels for new, unlabeled observations
- Predicts based on how similar training observations are to the new observations

#### Assumptions
- Data has little noise
- Data is labeled
- Data only contains relevant features
- Dataset has distinguishable subgroups
- Avoid using on large datasets
