### K-means clustering:
- Unsupervised clustering algorithm where we know how many clusters are appropriate
- Used to predict subgroups within a dataset
- Used for quickly predicting groupings in an unlabeled dataset
- Predicions based on the number of centroids present (K) and nearest mean values, given a Euclidian distance measurement between observations



### Keep in mind:
- Need to scale variables
- Look at scatterplot or data table to estimate the appropriate number of centroids to use for K parameter value
