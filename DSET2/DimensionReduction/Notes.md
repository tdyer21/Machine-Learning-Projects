### Factor Analysis
- Method which explores a data set to find root causes which explain why data acts a certain way. 
- Factors (latent variables) are meaningful but not inferred

#### Assumes
- features are metric, continuous, and ordinal
- r > 0.3 correlation between features
- > 100 observations and > 5 per feature
- Sample is homogenous

### Iris data set
- Attributes (predictive features)
- Sepal Length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

- Factor loading : if -1 or 1 it has a strong influence on the variable, ~0 is weak influence


## Singular Value Decomposition
- Linear algebra method that decomposes a matrix into three resultant matrices in order to reduce information reducdancy and noise
- primarily used for principle component analysis
- Unsupervised machine learning algorithm that reduces variables down to a set of uncorrelated synthetic representations


## Random Forest (Ensemble Models)
- ML methods that combine several base models to produce one optimal predictive model
- combine decisions from multiple models to improve overall performance
- Generate one model from other models to create a powerful all encompassing
