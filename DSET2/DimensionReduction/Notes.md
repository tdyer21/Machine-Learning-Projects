### Factor Analysis
- Method which explores a data set to find root causes which explain why data acts a certain way. 
- Factors (latent variables) are meaningful but not inferred

#### Assumes
- features are metric, continuous, and ordinal
- r > 0.3 correlation between features
- > 100 observations and > 5 per feature
- Sample is homogenous

### Iris data set
- Attributes (predictive features)
- Sepal Length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

- Factor loading : if -1 or 1 it has a strong influence on the variable, ~0 is weak influence
